This is a pre-recorded test mostly generated through selenium IDE.

And following is the scenario it covers:

Given the user is on cleartrip home page
When he searches with details for a one-way journey
Then he should get the outbound journey options

The @Test annotation signifies that the the method under consideration is a test method and can be run using TestNG
test framework.

We have just recorded one small ticket search flow using the Selenium IDE and pasted the generated code in here.
There is a Webdriver wait statement in the test that basically waits for the autocomplete options to appear when the
user starts typing the origin or destination city name.


Also notice the extra methods in the class. waitForSearchResultsToAppear().
This has been added purposefully to ensure that the test waits for the result page to appear. While writing the test we
noticed that the pageLoad on search button click was a little inconsistent and the test kept failing randomly. Hence,
we have added this to ensure consistency of the page load.
